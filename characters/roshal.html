			<h3>Meet Roshal</h3>
			<p>Roshal is a young freelance detective, he's responsible for finding small things people find unimportant. Mostly his clients are
			old ladies or young women.</p>
			<p class="spoiler">His believes are odd, he once read about an ancient religion in a book he found inside a bag he took by mistake.
			Because of that religion he started to work as a freelance detective.
			And because of that bag he found another purpose for his life, he fell in love with women's underwear.</p>
			<p>(see: <a href="">revelation</a> comic page)</p>
			<h3>Physical description</h3>
			<p>He wears a cap with a crescent moon, he has long black hair. Roshal never removes his glasses. I mean like NEVER!</p>
			<h3>Roshal's Philosophy</h3>
			<p>He thinks that beauty is hidden in the small things we barley notice, that includes small pieces of a woman's underwear. He is not ashamed of his small desires and says that this is a
			proof that he is honest to himself. Well, people fear things.</p>
			<p>Roshal loves making friendships with female teachers and female nurses as he loves chit-chatting and snooping about miniskirts.</p>
