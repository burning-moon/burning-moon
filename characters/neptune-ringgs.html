			<h3>Meet Neptune Ringgs</h3>
			<p>Neptune is the Molly's father and Ice's husband. His past is not clear but he joined V.S when he was much younger.</p>
			<p>His life changed when he met Kisoko, but it changed even more when he met <a href="molly-ringgs.html">Molly</a> for the first time. Before that, he hadn't any particular reason  to live for.</p>
			<h3>Physical/other description</h3>
			<p>He has a tied long hair and he usually wears medical glasses, strong and is stubborn. (See: slender madness)</p>
			<h3>Other</h3>
			<p>Neptune is hated by gangs because of his cruel nature, they even like Kisoko instead because of his serenity and calmness. He (Neptune) has a brother in the other side of the earth, and is more reckless and scarier than him.</p>
			<p>Days come and go and he discovers that he is the king of another planet and his partner in a god like woman. And in spite of everything he is the true friend</p>
